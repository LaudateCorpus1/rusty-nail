Rusty Nail is a drink making robot which uses a BeagleBone Green with a built-in
wifi peripheral. The idea is for this platform to use Rust for as much of the
robot as possible. The hardware used is not yet documented and still under
revision.

## Development Log

I have been keeping a set of development notes in this repository, to see them
