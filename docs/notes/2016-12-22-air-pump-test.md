# Experimenting with Air Pump Hardware

Order from 2016-12-17 came in.

## Construction

1. Took a seltzer bottle cap and drilled 2 1/4" holes in it.
2. Cut the 3/16" ID, 1/4" OD tubing into two pieces a longer and a shorter piece, one will feed from the cap to the motor and the other from the bottom of the container (through the cap) to the cup.
  - Note: the tubing is flimsy with 1/32" wall, but fits perfectly and tightly enough I did not need to use the silicone sealant to create a gasket/seal. This is good since it allows me to experiment with different bottles, and also clean the tubing easier and just throw out used/old caps.
3. I made sure one piece just passed 1/2" or so under the cap and the other tube went to the bottom of the bottle, with enough room to not have the flow disrupted by the bottom of the container.
4. Hooked the end which only goes a short distance into the bottle to the air pump.
5. Done!

## Test Procedure

1. Hooked up 12V accross pump, luckily the nozzle that broke off in shipment was for the vaccuum, so I can still use the pump. Pumps in either direction, so polarity does not seem to matter.
2. It ran and the air started pumping. Quite a bit of vibration, not quite sure how to mount it yet since there are no mounting flanges.

## Conclusion

Seems to work pretty well. I do need to measure pump
rates, but other than that it seems pretty straight
forward to me. It should work well.
