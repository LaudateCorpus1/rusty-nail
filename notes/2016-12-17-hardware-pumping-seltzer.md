# Hardware For Pumping Seltzer

To pump seltzer you can't use a peristaltic pump because it flattens the
seltzer. There  are some ways to pump carbonated beverages. I considered two:
One of them is to pump flat liquid and then carbonate it like a soda fountain.
I will try the second method first since the parts are cheaper for a
simple prototype and less prone to catastrophic failure.
